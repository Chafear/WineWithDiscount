Crabs.
Crabs are dangerous and never-forgiving. These magnificent and ancient creatures covered with a thick exoskeleton which even our most-powerful mining tools can't hurt. Crawling around and minding their own business. Some may wonder, how we even get in this conflict? The answer is pretty simple, one of our workers steal their eggs! Fock you Josh! Anyway, he is dead now. You can actually even see the exact moment of his death. And as I said crabs never forgive. We can't win here. We can't end this. We can only escape. But how many would endure this mess? 100? 50? 30? X? Who knows...
